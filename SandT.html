    TEACHERS OF S.P.S AND J.S.S BWARI CENTRAL <br>MEET'S DISGUIST THINGS ON THEIR TABLES AS <br>THEY APPROACHES THEIR
    DESKS ON MONDAY <br>TODAY (07/10/2019), AT SCHOOL, I. E, AFTER THE <br>WEEKEND.

<p id="p2">
        As teachers of S.P.S Bwari Central and Junior Secondary School Bwari Central approaches to school early morning
        today, they discovered some of the teachers' tables in the classes had some mess up of defecations that made
        staffs of the schools grow an encroachment to make a drastic move over the event and caused to recall back past
        events such relatively unmannered behaviors done before that the authorities of these institution settlement had
        wanted to forget about.
        The staffs in authorities have bitterly so much complained about this and is still complaining as requesting the
        government to temper into this matter by either aborting any kind of educational system type such as binding or
        either cross-binding tigers along with lambs (such as; clinging Primary Sectional Schools along with the
        Secondary Sectional Schools). This is in other to avoid bullies in Schools and hate rate amongst institutions.
        One of the purpose I think why such arrangement might initially have been made is to prevent the Junior Students
        to might have been bullied by the Senior Secondary Students, but reverse is the case that; "these Junior
        Secondary Students are even bullies to the staffs of the institutes."
        Please, we plead on behalf of the Schools in such times to be put into consideration as if, "if you were the one
        in such shoe, what would you do?"
