    All my life, since when I grew to understand the phenomenon of nature, I have had great men as my friends, but none
    has made me who I desired to be. They only sit me to blab (talk), but none gave me the chance to become myself, it's
    rather I make myself through them, our I remain a fool to let them make themselves through me.<br>
